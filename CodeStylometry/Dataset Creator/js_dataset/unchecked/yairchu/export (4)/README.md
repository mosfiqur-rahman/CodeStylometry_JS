## Lamdu export bundle

This bundle is an export of a Lamdu program.

### Lamdu

[Lamdu](http://lamdu.org) is a non-textual programming language/environment (source code is stored and edited as an AST).
As such, it has no textual format, but Lamdu code can be exported and shared in other means (see section below).

### Export bundle contents

* `source.lamdu`: Lamdu source of the exported program in a JSON-based format. It can be drag-and-dropped into Lamdu to load the code.
* `screenshot.png`: A screenshot of the program as seen in Lamdu. Note that this is just an overview of the program as not all subroutines used in it may be included in the screenshot. **Note**: The screenshot may be tiny (so its of a small piece of the code) or even missing due to Google Code Jam upload size restriction.
* `js/main.js`: The program compiled to JavaScript. One may run it to obtain the program output value. Run it with `$ NODE_PATH=. node --harmony-tailcalls main.js`. It requires a recent version of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) which supports the `--harmony-tailcalls` flag (>= v6.2.0).
* `js/rts.js`, `js/rtsConfig.js`: Support files for `js/main.js`. These modules implement the basic primitives of Lamdu in JavaScript (arithmetic, arrays, etc).
* `README.md`: The README which file you are reading right now.

### How to use this bundle

If you have Lamdu installed, just drag and drop `source.lamdu` to Lamdu to load the code.

Otherwise, start with the screenshot to get an overview of the code, and then you may further examine the compiled Javascript code (though note that it is a compiler output rather than handwritten Javascript), even examine the `source.lamdu` JSON file, but it isn't very human-readable and you can simply install Lamdu instead..
